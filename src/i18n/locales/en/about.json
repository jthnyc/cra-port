    "p1": "Hey there! I'm Joanna—a frontend engineer whose path into tech started in the music classroom, not the code editor.",
    "p2": "Most recently, I led the 9-month digital transformation for Kuang-hwa Vocational High School, a 70-year-old institution my grandfather founded. I project-managed a complete website overhaul—migrating from a legacy system to WordPress/Elementor on GCP, coordinating with designers and stakeholders to modernize how the school presents itself during a challenging enrollment period.",
    "p3": "Before that: music teaching → iOS development → MusicFirst (music ed startup, boosted renewals 21.9% through onboarding redesign) → Teachable (connected user feedback to engineering) → Grace Hopper → BORN Group (production-scale React/Redux for Converse, mentored junior devs). Each role pulled me deeper into the technical side, but also further from education and music. Now I'm building projects that combine all of it: SceneSync (film music classifier), PollyGlot (context-aware translation). Testing whether this intersection is where I should be.",
