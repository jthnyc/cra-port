    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "Hey there! I'm Joanna—a frontend engineer whose path into tech started in the music classroom, not the code editor.",
    "p2": "Most recently, I led the 9-month digital transformation for Kuang-Hwa Vocational Senior High School, a 70-year-old institution my grandfather founded. I project-managed a complete website overhaul—migrating from a legacy system to WordPress/Elementor on GCP, coordinating with designers and stakeholders to modernize how the school presents itself during a challenging enrollment period.",
    "p3-highlight": "The journey from music classroom to production engineering wasn't linear, but the thread is clear: I've always been drawn to tools that help people learn, create, or communicate.",
    "p3": "At MusicFirst, I redesigned onboarding that boosted renewals 21.9%. At Teachable, I turned user feedback into actionable engineering priorities, shaping what the product team built. At BORN Group, I built production React/Redux for Converse and mentored junior developers—made me a better engineer, but the connection to education and music felt distant. Now I'm testing whether that intersection is where I belong: SceneSync (film music classifier) and PollyGlot (context-aware translation) are experiments in building tools that feel both technically interesting and personally meaningful.",
