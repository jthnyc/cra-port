    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "Hey there! I'm Joanna—a frontend engineer passionate about crafting pixel-perfect, accessible, and engaging web experiences.",
    "p2": "My journey into tech began in the <0>classroom, not the code editor</0>. As a former music teacher, I saw how educational software often missed the mark for students and educators. Determined to bridge that gap, I transitioned into software development, starting with <1>iOS development</1> through Flatiron School's Mobile Dev Corps, where I honed my skills in Swift.",
    "p3": "After graduating, I joined a <2>music education startup</2>, leading APAC business development while continuing to code on the side. But my growing passion for development led me to take another deep dive—this time into <3>full-stack web development</3> through the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy.",
    "p4": "Since then, I've had the privilege of building <4>bespoke, high-traffic digital experiences</4>, for global brands at <5>BORN Group</5>. Most notably, I've contributed to <6>Converse's global platform</6>, where I <7>optimized checkout flows, product details, and account management</7> for an e-commerce site serving <8>~12M monthly visitors</8>. I also led the modernization of <9>legacy frontend architecture</9>, implmenting <10>React and Redux-based components</10> to improve site performance and maintainability.",
    "p5": "Now, I'm excited to keep <11>pushing the boundaries of frontend development</11> collaborating with teams that build <12>high-quality, scalable web experiences</12>, and solving real-world problems through code.",
