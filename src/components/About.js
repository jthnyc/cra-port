      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <AboutContent>
        <AboutText>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Joannaâ€”a frontend engineer passionate about crafting 
            pixel-perfect, accessible, and engaging web experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into tech began in the <strong>classroom, not the code editor</strong>. As a former music teacher, 
            I saw how educational software often missed the mark for students and educators.
            Determined to bridge that gap, I transitioned into software development, 
            starting with <strong>iOS development</strong> through Flatiron School's Mobile Dev Corps, 
            where I honed my skills in Swift.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating, I joined a <strong>music education startup</strong>, leading APAC business 
            development while continuing to code on the side. But my growing passion 
            for development led me to take another deep diveâ€”this time into <strong>full-stack 
            web development</strong> through the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I've had the privilege of building <strong>bespoke, high-traffic digital experiences</strong>, 
            for global brands at <strong>BORN Group</strong>. Most notably, I've contributed to <strong>
            Converse's global platform</strong>, where I <strong>optimized checkout flows,
            product details, and account management</strong> for an e-commerce site serving <strong>~12M monthly visitors</strong>.
            I also led the modernization of <strong>legacy frontend architecture</strong>, implmenting <strong>React 
            and Redux-based components</strong> to improve site performance and maintainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I'm excited to keep <strong>pushing the boundaries of frontend development</strong> collaborating 
            with teams that build <strong>high-quality, scalable web experiences</strong>, 
            and solving real-world problems through code.
          </p>
